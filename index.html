        <p>Meet Bruce Wayne and he’s definitely the class clown! He’s a 7-month-old male neutered rottweiler that I rescued following nairobi floods. His owners relinquished him to a shelter just before moving upcountry but he had already been neglected for quite some time as he was emaciated! He was also Heartworm positive but we have since treated that and he has a clean bill of health!</p>
